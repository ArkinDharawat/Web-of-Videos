And with such a framework, the input data can be partitioned into multiple parts. Each is processed in parallel first by map, and then in the process after we reach the reduce stage, then much more reduce functions can also further process
And this is also called a Jelinek and Mercer smoothing. So the idea is actually very simple. This picture shows how we estimate document language model by using maximum [INAUDIBLE] method, that gives us word counts normalized by the total number of words in the text. The idea of using this method is to
