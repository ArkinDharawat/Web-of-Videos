It's a very difficult challenge. For measures, it's also challenging because what we want with measures is that with accuracy reflected the perceived utility of users. We have to consider carefully what the users care about and then design measures to measure that. If we, your measure is not measuring the right thing, then your conclusion would, would be misled.

So this seems to make more sense than a fixed coefficient smoothing. Of course, this part would be of this form, so that the two coefficients would sum to 1. Now, this is one way to understand that this is smoothing. Basically, it means that it's a dynamic coefficient interpolation.
